                                Water can cause damage and defects to the fabric of buildings either by undesired entry
                                or the inability of water vapour to exit a building in a controlled way. This can result in primary
                                degradation of building materials causing loss of intended functionality which may in turn lead to
                                secondary degradation by fungal and mould growth. The cause of such defects can include the loss of the
                                integrity of weatherproof finishes and damp proof membranes, leaking plumbing or drainage pipe work and
                                the poor design and/or installation of vapour barriers. The correct identification of the causes of an
                                issue, together with the design and implementation of appropriate remedial works are important for
                                maintaining the value of the property and contents, together with the health and well-being of its
                                occupants.

                                The unintended movement of building structures causes cracking of buildingâ€™s finishes and possibly the
                                over stressing of structural elements. In extreme cases this can lead to the partial or total collapse
                                of a building. Such movement can be caused by earthquakes, changes to the ground conditions under a
                                building or the inadequacy of component structural elements the building. Many buildings display cracks
                                of some sort and recognising the different types and causes is crucial to understanding the structural
                                integrity and interventions that may be required.

                                The performance of a building on fire is first and foremost critical to the life safety of its occupants
                                and emergency responders, be it residential apartments or large commercial or industrial buildings. The
                                passive fire resistance of a building is determined by its compartmental design, incorporated materials
                                and finishes together with the fire load of its contents. The fundamental purpose of passive fire
                                resistance together with appropriate active systems, such as sprinklers, fire shutter, smoke extract
                                systems and the like is to enable the occupants of the building to escape to a place of safety. I have
                                significant experience in passive fire design, inspection compliance with state regulations and
                                insurance standards, together with the integration of active fire safety components and systems. I do
                                not inspect the functionality or efficacy of active fire safety components or systems.

                                Acoustic issues with buildings generally fall into three categories: firstly noise ingress into a
                                building from and outside source, secondly, the transmission of noise between two or more parts of a
                                build contained within the same overall envelope (neighbour noise) and thirdly issues with the acoustic
                                environment within a particular space in a building, such as long reverberation time or echo. The
                                measurement and analysis of many noise penetration issues is particularly important as the design of
                                possible solutions is very dependent on the frequency spectrum or of the Intrusive sound. Having
                                undertaken the acoustic design of new multifunctional performance spaces and remedial design solutions
                                to reverberation and insulation problem, I am aware of the practical limitation in this field.

                                years as it works well and has proved financially beneficial to clients.
