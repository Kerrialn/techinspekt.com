                <p>
                    If you have a particular issue with a building or element of a building and wish to know the cause
                    and possible remedies, you can book an appointment for an initial on-site discussion of the matter.
                    You will receive an initial appraisal of the matter, together with a way forward and cost of
                    providing the complete service. The cost of this initial consultation is 5,500 CZK within the Prague
                    area. If outside of Prague Hlavni mesto the price is 5,500 CZK plus 15 CZK per kilometre of travel
                    distance from Prague 7 to and from the site location.

                        <b>Water</b>
                        <p>Water can cause damage and defects to the fabric of buildings either by undesired entry
                            or the inability of water vapour to exit a building in a controlled way. This can result in
                            primary
                            degradation of building materials causing loss of intended functionality which may in turn
                            lead to
                            secondary degradation by fungal and mould growth. The cause of such defects can include the
                            loss of the
                            integrity of weatherproof finishes and damp proof membranes, leaking plumbing or drainage
                            pipe work and
                            the poor design and/or installation of vapour barriers. The correct identification of the
                            causes of an
                            issue, together with the design and implementation of appropriate remedial works are
                            important for
                            maintaining the value of the property and contents, together with the health and well-being
                            of its
                            occupants.</p>

                        <p>
                            The unintended movement of building structures causes cracking of buildingâ€™s finishes and
                            possibly the
                            over stressing of structural elements. In extreme cases this can lead to the partial or
                            total collapse
                            of a building. Such movement can be caused by earthquakes, changes to the ground conditions
                            under a
                            building or the inadequacy of component structural elements the building. Many buildings
                            display cracks
                            of some sort and recognising the different types and causes is crucial to understanding the
                            structural
                            integrity and interventions that may be required.

                        <b> Fire</b>
                        <p>
                            The performance of a building on fire is first and foremost critical to the life safety of
                            its occupants
                            and emergency responders, be it residential apartments or large commercial or industrial
                            buildings. The
                            passive fire resistance of a building is determined by its compartmental design,
                            incorporated materials
                            and finishes together with the fire load of its contents. The fundamental purpose of passive
                            fire
                            resistance together with appropriate active systems, such as sprinklers, fire shutter, smoke
                            extract
                            systems and the like is to enable the occupants of the building to escape to a place of
                            safety. I have
                            significant experience in passive fire design, inspection compliance with state regulations
                            and
                            insurance standards, together with the integration of active fire safety components and
                            systems. I do
                            not inspect the functionality or efficacy of active fire safety components or systems.

                        <b> Acoustics</b>
                        <p>
                            Acoustic issues with buildings generally fall into three categories: firstly noise ingress
                            into a
                            building from and outside source, secondly, the transmission of noise between two or more
                            parts of a
                            build contained within the same overall envelope (neighbour noise) and thirdly issues with
                            the acoustic
                            environment within a particular space in a building, such as long reverberation time or
                            echo. The
                            measurement and analysis of many noise penetration issues is particularly important as the
                            design of
                            possible solutions is very dependent on the frequency spectrum or of the Intrusive sound.
                            Having
                            undertaken the acoustic design of new multifunctional performance spaces and remedial design
                            solutions
                            to reverberation and insulation problem, I am aware of the practical limitation in this
                            field.

                            of a
